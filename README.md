###### Welcome to FLLW ðŸ‘‹ 

FLLW is an auto-run package for spwn! whenever you save a `.spwn` file, the program will close Geometry Dash, compile the designated file (using spwn), and run Geometry Dash.

###### Support â›” 

Since this is a `.exe` file, it will only work on windows.
A mac build is currently being made ðŸ‘·

# run FLLW

to run FLLW, have the exe in your directory and type this into the terminal

```terminal
$ ./fllw [flags] <filename>
```

_flags are optional_

_filename can be the filename or filename.spwn, FLLW will add .spwn to the end of the filename if it doesn't have it already_
